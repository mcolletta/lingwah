A parser combinator library written in Java

With lingwah you can express a context-free grammar directly using lingwah's combinators.
Unlike most other parsing tools, you don't have to refactor your grammar to eliminate left recursion.

Lingwah uses the memoization and 'continuation-passing' techniques described in the paper ["Memoization in Top-Down Parsing"](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/cmp-lg/pdf/9504/9504016v1.pdf) by Mark Johnson

Status...this project is an ongoing concern.
It is currenyly being used by [lohr](http://code.google.com/p/lohr/).
